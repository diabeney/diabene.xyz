Modeling bioreactors is an essential part of biochemical and process engineering. Whether you're working on batch fermentation or continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs), **MATLAB** provides a powerful platform for simulating these systems.

In this post, weâ€™ll walk through writing a **MATLAB script** to model a simple bioreactor using ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

## ðŸ§ª What is a Bioreactor?

A **bioreactor** is a vessel used for carrying out biological reactions. These can range from small-scale lab fermenters to large-scale industrial systems. The goal is often to grow cells or produce a biochemical product efficiently.

Common bioreactor types:

- **Batch**
- **Fed-batch**
- **Continuous (CSTR)**

## ðŸŽ¯ Modeling Objectives

We'll model a **batch bioreactor** with the following components:

- **Substrate (S)**: Consumed by the microorganisms.
- **Biomass (X)**: The growing cells.
- **Product (P)**: The desired biochemical output.

Weâ€™ll assume Monod kinetics for growth:

## ðŸ’» Writing the MATLAB Script

Letâ€™s break it down.

### Step 1: Define Parameters and Initial Conditions

```matlab
% Parameters
mu_max = 0.4;      % 1/hr
Ks = 0.1;          % g/L
Yxs = 0.5;         % g biomass / g substrate
Ypx = 0.2;         % g product / g biomass

% Initial conditions
S0 = 10;           % Substrate (g/L)
X0 = 0.1;          % Biomass (g/L)
P0 = 0;            % Product (g/L)
initial_conditions = [X0 S0 P0];

% Time span
tspan = [0 30];    % hours
```
