Modeling bioreactors is an essential part of biochemical and process engineering. Whether you're working on batch fermentation or continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs), **MATLAB** provides a powerful platform for simulating these systems.

In this post, weâ€™ll walk through writing a **MATLAB script** to model a simple bioreactor using ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
